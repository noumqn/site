I am an experienced game designer with proficiency in Unity and expertise in gameplay and level design, as well as experience with documentation and research. I have successfully created detailed game design documents and technical documents to facilitate communication between teams. I have also worked on a variety of genres and games, including story-based escape games, and have been a part of a game development project that garnered over 100k downloads. I am excited to bring my skills and experience to a new challenge in game design.
